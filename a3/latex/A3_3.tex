\noindent\textbf{Database system and version:} {\it e.g., PostgreSQL}

\subsection*{Question 1: Index Data Structures} Which index data structures (e.g., $B^+$-tree
index) are supported?

\vspace{1em}
B+-Tree\\
Hash\\
GIN (Generalized Inverted Indexes)\\
GiST (Generalized Search Tree)\\
SP-GiST (Space partitioned GiST)\\
BRIN (Block range indexes)

\subsection*{Question 2: Clustered Indexes} Discuss how the system
supports clustered indexes, in particular:

\paragraph{2a)} How do you create a clustered index on {\tt ssnum}?
Show the query.\footnote{Give the queries for creating a hash index
  \emph{and} a $B^+$-tree index if both of them are supported.}

\vspace{1em}
When marking columns as primary key, Postgres automatically creates
a $B^+$-tree index for them; otherwise it could not check the uniqueness
efficiently.

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
B+-Tree: ALTER TABLE Employee ADD PRIMARY KEY (ssnum);
CLUSTER Employee USING ssnum_pkey;

Hash: CREATE INDEX ssnum_index ON Employee USING hash (ssnum);
CLUSTER Employee USING ssnum_index;
\end{verbatim}
}

\paragraph{2b)} Are clustered indexes on non-key attributes supported, e.g.,
on {\tt name}?  Show the query.

\vspace{1em}
This works in a similar fashion: You first create a regular index
on the attribute, then cluster the data by the index.

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
CREATE INDEX name_index ON Employee (name);
CLUSTER Employee USING name_index;
\end{verbatim}
}

\paragraph{2c)} Is the clustered index dense or sparse?

\vspace{1em}
Since Postgres only supports heap
tables (unordered tuples on disk), a dense index is required to address
every tuple.

\paragraph{2d)} How does the system deal with overflows in clustered indexes?
How is the fill factor controlled?

\vspace{1em}
When creating an index, Postgres allows one to specify the fillfactor like so:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
CREATE INDEX name_index ON Employee (name) WITH (fillfactor=70);
\end{verbatim}
}

This means the leaf nodes of the $B^+$-tree will only be 70\% full
when the index is created. This allows new records to be added for some time
until index pages need to be split. It has the drawback of making the index
larger than necessary and thus degrading read performance.

\paragraph{2e)} Discuss any further characteristics of the system
related to clustered indexes that are relevant to a database
tuner?

\smallskip

\vspace{1em}
Since PostgreSQL only supports heap tables, a clustered index in the strict sense
is not possible. We can however cluster the data using a given index. The data
gets physically sorted on the disk, clustering however is a one-time operation
and inserted/deleted data is not automatically clustered, leading to performance
degradation.\\

\subsection*{Question 3: Non-Clustered Indexes}

Discuss how the system supports non-clustered indexes, in
particular:

\paragraph{3a)} How do you create a non-clustered index on {\tt
  (dept,salary)}? Show the query.$^1$

\vspace{1em}
Just create an index on (dept,salary), PostgreSQL doesn't have clustered indices.

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
CREATE INDEX dept_salary_index ON Employee (dept,salary);
\end{verbatim}
}

\paragraph{3b)} Can the system take advantage of covering indexes? What if the
index covers the query, but the condition is not a prefix of the
attribute sequence {\tt (dept,salary)}?


\smallskip

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
Yes, it supports covering indexes.
Aggregate  (cost=1862.31..1862.32 rows=1 width=2)
  ->  Index Only Scan using dept_salary_index on employee  (cost=0.29..1862.31 rows=2 width=2)
        Index Cond: (salary = 1000)
If the condition is not a prefix, the system uses a bitmap heap scan.
Aggregate  (cost=966.63..966.64 rows=1 width=4)
  ->  Bitmap Heap Scan on employee  (cost=74.39..956.92 rows=3883 width=4)
        Recheck Cond: ((dept)::text = 'A'::text)
        ->  Bitmap Index Scan on dept_salary_index  (cost=0.00..73.42 rows=3883 width=0)
              Index Cond: ((dept)::text = 'A'::text)
\end{verbatim}
}

\paragraph{3c)} Discuss any further characteristics of the system related to
non-clustered indexes that are relevant to a database tuner?

\subsection*{Question 4: Key Compression and Page Size} If your system
supports $B^+$-trees, what kind of key compression (if any) does it
support?  How large is the default disk page? Can it be changed?
